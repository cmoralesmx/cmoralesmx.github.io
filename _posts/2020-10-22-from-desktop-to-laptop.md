Recently, I had to switch the form factor of my main computer. Going from a
desktop to a laptop was not an easy step for me.
Why? Let me offer some background.

Until a few months ago, I had the impression laptop processors were weak, they
had awful keyboards, and the user-serviceability was almost non-existent. 
I still think this is the reality of the laptop market with very few
exceptions on the consumer-oriented laptop market. But...

Concerning the keyboards, only the ThinkPad line seems to still offer
good keyboards.  
About serviceability, enterprise-oriented laptops or workstations
cover my needs.  
What about dedicated graphics? Those available on high-end gaming laptops are
alright-ish, their performance still pales in comparison with similar desktop
versions but those laptops are too flashy.  
What about the processors? On the one hand, Intel has been offering mostly the
same processors for the last 10 years. On the other hand, AMD's processors'
performance had always been sub par, until a few months ago.

So, yes, I am not a fan of the laptop form factor yet I am seeing the need to
adopt this form factor due to current circumstances.

Based on my needs, ThinkPad laptops are the ones most likely covering my needs. 
Yet, their processor are weak.

Then, I met the Lenovo Legion 5P, a non-attention-grabbing gaming laptop 
with decent keyboard for actual typing, good serviceability, silent when not
under load (it has good thermals), weighing under 3kg, and costing less than Â£999!

I can finally do CUDA development on the move without having to ssh to another
system!  

I am OK with it's GPU for prototyping, no consumer-oriented GPU is
going to come even close to the performance available from HPC GPUs and this
one almost matches the performance I was used to at my desktop.

*1-month UPDATE*  
Alright, I think this is an (almost) perfect laptop for me! It has some flaws
but they are due to the lack of GNU/Linux support from the manufacturer.
Unfortunately, this computer was only intended to be used with Windows. 

Despite Lenovo offering Linux-certified computers, this is not one of them
so GNU/Linux is not officially supported on this device. Yet, using Windows for
software development, after enjoying the freedom of GNU/Linux for the last five
years, feels like a grotesque experience.

Therefore, I decided to stick to GNU/Linux and try to sort any issues myself.

But I will leave that for another post where I am planning to document
the [Linux support on the Lenovo Legion 5P](/blog/2020/legion-5P-linux-support.html)
