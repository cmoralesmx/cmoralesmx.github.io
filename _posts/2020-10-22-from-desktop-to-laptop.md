Recently, I had to switch the form factor of my main computer.  
Going from a desktop to a laptop was not an easy step for me.
Why? Well, Until a few months ago, I was certain their mobile processors were
weak, they had awful keyboards, and were mostly non user-serviceable products.

Anyway, I realized the market is either limiting my options to light but less 
capable or capable but bulky devices.  

Therefore, some compromise was made here. Meet the Lenovo Legion 5P, a 
non-attention-grabbing gaming laptop with decent keyboard, good serviceability,
mostly silent (it has good thermals), and weighing under 3kg.

This device will allow me to do CUDA development on the move without having to 
ssh to another system! It's GPU seems to be OK for prototyping. Actually, the
whole system almost matches the performance I was used to at my desktop. 
Not bad at all!  

*1-month UPDATE*  
Alright, I think this is an (almost) perfect laptop for me! It has some flaws 
but is not that bad.  

Despite Lenovo offering Linux-certified computers, this is not one of them
so GNU/Linux is not officially supported on this device.
Having enjoyed the liberating experience of using and developing on GNU/Linux 
for the last five years, considering going back to the Windows ecosystem seems 
like a grotesque experience I prefer to avoid.

Therefore, I decided to stick with GNU/Linux and try to sort any issues myself.

I am planning to use this space to document my experience with this laptop and 
GNU/Linux through a series of posts. The first of them, [Linux support on the Lenovo Legion 5P](/blog/2020/legion-5P-linux-support/), is available now. Go have a read!
