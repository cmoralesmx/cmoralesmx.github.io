I am a 4th year Ph.D student in Computer Science. My work sits at the intersection of Computer Science and Biology. I apply Agent-Based Modelling to explore the emergent cell-level communication in the fertilisation process in mammals.

Besides research, I am a Certified AWS Cloud Solutions Architect and Developer providing consultation services for cloud computing on Amazon Web Services. As such, my main concern is to cater for the security, reliability, fault tolerancy of the clientâ€™s data and infrastructure according to the principles and best practices recommended by the Well Architected Framework. All in all, I am passionate about the cloud and am actively looking to transition into a high responsibility role where I can apply my skills and experiences, and grow professionally.

For further details of my proffessional experience and academic background please check in my CV

With respect to my personal interests, I am passionate about cycling, travelling, coffee tasting, and open source software development among other things. You can read more about these in my blog.
