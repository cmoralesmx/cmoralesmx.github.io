I am an AWS Certified Solutions Architect and Developer 
providing consultation services for cloud computing on Amazon Web Services. As 
such, my main concern is the security, reliability, and fault tolerance of the
clientâ€™s data and infrastructure according to the principles and best
practices laid out by the AWS Well-Architected Framework. 
I am passionate about the cloud and actively looking to transition into a 
high-responsibility role where I can apply my skills and experience to benefit 
my employer while furthering my professional development.

Besides Cloud Consulting, I am a 4th-year PhD student in Computer Science. My
work sits at the intersection of Computer Science and Biology. I apply Agent-Based
Modelling to explore the emergent cell-level communication in the fertilisation
process in mammals.

My resume is available for details of my professional experience and academic 
formation. Check the link at the top of the page.

Concerning my personal interests, I am passionate about cycling, travelling, 
coffee tasting, and open-source software.
