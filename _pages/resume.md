**September 2016 - Present**, ***PhD in Computer Science***, The University of
Sheffield, UK.

My research sits at the intersection of Computer Science and Biology.
My focus is on applying Agent-Based Modelling to mammalian
reproduction research. I am working under the supervision of Dr Dawn Walker
and Prof. Alireza Fazeli.

From a technical perspective, I create
computational models where many autonomous decision-making 
individuals bound to simple low-level rules, encoded into the 
model, interact with each other and with the environment. 
After enough time, outcome of said interactions, system-wide complex high-level behaviour will emerge. Such behaviour, not encoded into the model, allows researchers to gaze at the mechanisms underpining the system of interest.

As product of my PhD, a [virtual reality serious game](https://cmoralesmx.github.io/FertilizationVR_web/)
was created. In it, you experience being a spermatozoon facing a series of obstacles which you must overcome to fertilise an egg while beating the other spermatozoa competing in the same task.
This project has been invited for demonstration at a series of public talks
"[Sex-In-Three Cities](https://srf-reproduction.org/events/sex-in-three-cities-events/)"
at the Universities of Nottingham, Edinburgh, and the Royal Veterinary College
in London sponsored by the [Society for Reproduction and Fertility](https://srf-reproduction.org/).

The project was awarded best-poster prizes at international (Fertility'19) and regional (INSIGNEO showcase 2019) conferences.

Experience gained in: CUDA, C, Python, Matlab, OpenGL, public speaking, scientific research, project management, data management, data analysis.

**September 2017 - September 2019**, ***Lab demonstrator***, The University of Sheffield, UK

In parallel to my research project, I provided support for undergraduate and
MSc students on the practical sessions for Python-based courses, i.e.: Text
Processing, Natural Language Processing, Biology-Inspired Computing.

Experience gained in: Python and Matlab programming, post-graduate teaching, and problem solving in a diverse multi-cultural environment

----
**September 2015 - September 2016**, ***MSc in Computer Science***, The University
of Sheffield, UK

With a strong focus in Natural Language Processing, for my thesis I applied
Latent Semantic Analysis to study the "Textual Alignment of News Blogs".

Experience gained in: Python, CUDA, and Java programming, team work, multi-cultural awareness

----
**May 2013 - August 2015**, ***Java developer/tech lead*** Enterprise Business
Consulting, Queretaro, Mexico.

I was successfully involved in many projects, as follows.

- On the full life cycle of five Java based solutions for electronic invoicing
and one email client tailored to the client needs.
- I architected several stateful web services clients.
- I architected and implemented data migration pipelines from legacy systems
and from SAP ERP to our implementations.

I am specially proud of my involvement as a tech leader for a high-risk project where I lead a team of 7 developers during the final months of development of a custom ERP software. 
My participation was key for the successful delivery and implementation of this project.

Experience gained in: Java, SOAP web services, SAP ABAP, PHP, SQL Server, MySQL

----
**September 2010 - February 2013**, ***BSc in Informatics***, UPEMOR, Jiutepec,
Mexico

For my thesis, I implemented and benchmarked an Asynchronous Bidirectional
Associative Memory (ABAM).

**September 2011 - September 2012**, ***Tech Support***, UPEMOR, Jiutepec,
Mexico

In parallel to my undergraduate studies, I joined the IT department providing
technical support at the university's computer labs.

My duties involved software installations, computer maintenance, and minor tech support.

Experience gained in: Troubleshooting, customer service.

----
**2008 - 2010**, ***Web developer***, GrupoSol/Intermex, Cuernavaca, Mexico.

I developed custom PHP web sites and portals from the ground up. Initially,
I was only involved in design and implementation, later I was trusted with
infrastructure activities.

My work, as the sole developer at the time, was key in supporting the agency's
transition from a print-focused business with minimal web operations to a
web-focused AD agency with minimal print activity.

Experience gained in: PHP, MySQL

----
**2002 - 2008**, ***PHP developer***, MaranathaMX, Cuernavaca, Mexico.

I self-learned HTML 4.0 and PHP programming and offered my services
independently for a few years catering specifically to small business.

However, my proudest achievement was developing a larger portal which
eventually became the first version of the China-Mexico Chamber of Commerce
web portal. This was a three-lingual website/portal when internationalisation
was still an "exotic" area of development.

Experience gained in: PHP, MySQL
