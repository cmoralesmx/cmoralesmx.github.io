<blockquote class="statement">
A resourceful full-stack software developer with hands-on
professional experience. I am confident creating or working with complex
systems. A philomath. An open source, clean code and best practices enthusiast
with a new found passion for cloud computing.

**September 2016 - Present**, PhD in Computer Science, The University of
Sheffield.

My research sits at the intersection of Computer Science and Biology. The
project mainly focuses on applying Agent-Based Modelling to mammalian
reproduction research. I am working under the supervision of Dr Dawn Walker
and Prof. Alireza Fazeli.

To summarize my PhD in a short paragraph, from a technical perspective, I create
computational models where many autonomous decision-making individuals bound
by simple low-level rules encoded into the system will interact with each other
and with the environment and, hopefully, after enough iterations, complex
system-wide high-level behaviour will emerge as an outcome of those interactions.

As product of my PhD, a [virtual reality serious game](https://cmoralesmx.github.io/FertilizationVR_web/)
was created where you take the place of a spermatozoon and must face a series
of obstacles to fertilise an egg while beating other spermatozoa competing in
the same task.
This project has been invited for demonstration at a series of public talks
"[Sex-In-Three Cities](https://srf-reproduction.org/events/sex-in-three-cities-events/)"
at the Universities of Nottingham, Edinburgh, and the Royal Veterinary College
in London sponsored by the [Society for Reproduction and Fertility](https://srf-reproduction.org/).
*We are looking for funding to continue this project!*

**September 2017 - September 2019**, ***Lab demonstrator***, The University of Sheffield

In parallel to my research project, I provided support for undergraduate and
MSc students on the practical sessions for Python-based courses, i.e.: Text
Processing, Natural Language Processing, Biology-Inspired Computing.

----
**September 2015 - September 2016**, ***MSc in Computer Science***, The University
of Sheffield

With a strong focus in Natural Language Processing, for my thesis I applied
Latent Semantic Analysis to study the "Textual Alignment of News Blogs".

----
**May 2013 - August 2015**, ***Java developer/tech lead*** Enterprise Business
Consulting, Queretaro, Mexico.

I was successfully involved in many projects, as follows.

- On the full life cycle of five Java based solutions for electronic invoicing
and one custom email client.
- I architected several stateful web services clients.
- I architected and implemented data migration pipelines from legacy systems
and from SAP ERP to our implementations.

I am proud of my involvement as a tech lead of a team of 7 junior developers
during the final eight months of development and later during the
implementation stage of a custom ERP software for a medium sized
enterprise. My participation was key for the successful delivery of this
project qualified as high risk of failure prior to my involvement.

**September 2010 - February 2013**, ***BSc in Informatics***, UPEMOR, Jiutepec,
Mexico

For my thesis, I implemented and benchmarked an Asynchronous Bidirectional
Associative Memory (ABAM).

**September 2011 - September 2012**, ***Tech Support***, UPEMOR, Jiutepec,
Mexico

In parallel to my undergraduate studies, I joined the IT department providing
technical support at the university's computer labs.

My duties involved software installations, computer maintenance, and minor
tech support to the students.

----
**2008 - 2010**, ***Web developer***, GrupoSol/Intermex, Cuernavaca, Mexico.

I developed custom PHP web sites and portals from the ground up. Initially,
I was only involved in design and implementation, later I was trusted with
infrastructure activities.

My work, as the sole developer at the time, was key in supporting the agency's
transition from a print-focused business with minimal web operations to a
web-focused AD agency with minimal print activity.

----
**2002 - 2008**, ***PHP developer***, MaranathaMX, Cuernavaca, Mexico.

I self-learned HTML 4.0 and PHP programming and offered my services
independently for a few years catering specifically to small business.

However, my proudest achievement was developing a larger portal which
eventually became the first version of the China-Mexico Chamber of Commerce
web portal. This was a three-lingual website/portal when internationalisation
was still an "exotic" area of development.
