The work done during my PhD sits at the intersection of Computer Science and 
Biology. My project mainly focuses on applying Agent-Based Modelling to
mammalian reproduction research. I am working under the supervision of
Dr Dawn Walker and Prof. Alireza Fazelli.

To summarize my PhD in a short paragraph, from a technical perspective, I create 
computational models where many autonomous decision-making individuals bound
by simple low-level rules encoded into the system will interact with each other
and with the environment and, hopefully, after enough iterations, complex
system-wide high-level behaviour will emerge as an outcome of those interactions.
Although I refer to the modelling technique as Agent-Based Modelling (ABM),
other areas of research use different names for the same technique, 
i.e.: Individual-Based Modelling for ecologists.

During this time, I have worked as a lab demonstrator supporting undergrad and
MSc students in a variety of courses taught in Python, i.e.: Text Processing,
Natural Language Processing, Biological Computing.

As a side product of my PhD, a virtual reality (VR) serious game was created
where you take the place of a spermatozoon and must face a series of obstacles
to fertilise an egg while beating other sperms competing in the same task.
This project has been invited for demonstration at a series of public talks
"Sex-In-Three Cities" at the Universities of London, Nottingham, and Edinburgh
sponsored by the Society for Reproduction and Fertility. We are looking for
funding to continue this project!

Sep 2015 - Sept 2016, I completed an ***MSc in Computer Science*** with a strong
focus in Natural Language Processing, for my thesis I applied Latent Semantic
Analysis to study the "Textual Alignment of News Blogs".

May 2013 - Aug 2015, I was employed as **technical lead** at an enterprise
services startup in Queretaro, Mexico.
My main responsibilities were process and requirement analysis, software
implementation, and project administration of Java based solutions for
electronic invoicing, stateful web services, data migrations, and email services. 
I also lead a team of 7 junior developers on the final part of the development
stage and later on the implementation of a custom ERP software for a medium sized
enterprise. For a brief period of time, I was also in charge of the internal
infrastructure of the startup doing SAP Basis activities.

Sep 2010 - Feb 2013, I completed a ***bachelor degree*** (informatics) at the
Polytechnic University of Morelos (UPEMOR) in Jiutepec, Mexico.
For my thesis, I implemented and benchmarked an Asynchronous Bidirectional
Associative Memory (ABAM). To cover my expenses I joined the IT department
providing technical support at the university's computer labs. The activities
carried involved software installations, computer maintenance.

2008 - 2010, I worked as a **web developer** at an AD agency in Cuernavaca,
Mexico. My work here consisted of developing PHP based web sites for their
small-business clients. I was in charge of designing, implementation, and
 infrastructure.
As the sole developer at the time, my work was key in supporting the agency's
transition from a print-focused business with minimal web operations to a
web-focused AD agency with minimal print activity.

2002 - 2008, I self-learned HTML and PHP programming and offered my service
independently for a few years. Although, I was focused only in small business,
I did create a larger scale portal which was the first version of the
China-Mexico Chamber of Commerce. This was a three-lingual web portal when i18n 
(internationalisation)  was still an exotic area of development.
