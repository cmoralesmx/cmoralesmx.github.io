I am currently on the final stretch of a PhD project where I have been applying
**Agent-Based Modelling** to study complex biological phenomena using **CUDA**
and **multiprocessing** both in HPC and commodity hardware environments.  

Some achievements of this project:
- It has been awarded a few best poster prizes at international joint
conferences and showcases.  
- A virtual reality serious game, product of my PhD, has been invited for 
demonstration at a series of public talks across the UK sponsored by the
Society for Reproduction and Fertility (SRF).  
- The main funding for this project was awarded as scholarship from Mexico's
Council of Science and Technology. I am thankful for their support.

A **full CV** is available [here](/cv) with more detail about previous work
experience and education history.

I am a bit of a philomath with eclectic ***interests*** and just recently started
writing about it on my blog [think, code, cycle](/blog). The topics I care about are,
- ***OSS development***. I maintain an [R package](https://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/gggap){:target="\_blank"}
and have contributed code to others.
- ***GNU/Linux***. My main computer runs [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/){:target="\_blank"}.
My [home network](/blog/home_network_fully_run_by_Linux) runs on Linux.
- ***Cloud Computing***. I am preparing to get certified as an [AWS](
https://aws.amazon.com/) solutions architect
- ***Reading***. Although, nowadays my reading is scientific literature and technical
papers, I quite enjoy getting immersed in nonfiction works especially of
the biography, history, and travelogue type.
- ***Travelling***. Travelogues are good, but nothing beats first-hand experiencing
other cultures and their cousines, seeing new places with my own eyes, and the
boost in problem solving skills that comes with travelling. Life is too short
to live it vicariously through others. Sadly, this on pause at the moment.
- ***Road cycling***. I have had the fortune of living in a city with plenty of hilly
roads to enjoy, some with national hill climbing fame while others have been
featured in a few of the thoughtest cycling routes in the UK. I thrive pushing
myself to go further, faster. You can find me on [strava](https://strava.com/athletes/20777326)
