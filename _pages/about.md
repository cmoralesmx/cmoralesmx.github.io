Hello, I am Carlos A. Morales.

A cloud computing enthusiast software developer who is also  bit of a 
philomath with eclectic  ***interests***, but mostly just a simple person really.

Recently, I've been writing on my blog [think, code, cycle](/blog) about the 
topics I care about some of which are,

- ***Cloud Computing***. Besided holding [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
Solutions Architect and Developer certifications, I recently completed the 
[Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/), a hands-on capstone 
project coverign a broad spectrum of cloud skills. The whole experience, which
I wrote about in [this post](/blog/2022-02-22-my-cloud-resume-challenge-in-aws.html), was more testing than anticipated yet very rewarding on completion. 
Being passionate about the cloud, and aiming to become multi-cloud capable, I am
now planning a second go at tackling this involved project under [GCP](https://cloud.google.com).
- ***Travelling***. Nothing beats seeing new places with my own eyes!
The thrill of experiencing other cultures and their cuisines fascinates me. I 
am especially keen in doing so by getting out of the city centres, the typical
tourists spots, and getting more into the countryside.
- ***Cycling***. Both due to its benefits for my physical and mental health, and
because I thrive pushing myself to go further, faster. This is a highly enoyable
 activity for me. I keep track of my outings using [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/20777326).

<blockquote>Life is too short to live it vicariously through others.</blockquote>

I am currently on the final stretch of a PhD project where I have been applying
**Agent-Based Modelling** to study complex biological phenomena using 
highly-parallel processors in both High Performance Computing (HPC) and commodity hardware environments.

Some achievements of this project:
- It has been awarded a few best poster prizes at international conferences and
showcases.
- A [virtual reality serious game](https://cmoralesmx.github.io/FertilizationVR_web/),
product of my PhD, has been invited for demonstration at a series of public
talks across the UK sponsored by the [Society for Reproduction and Fertility](https://srf-reproduction.org/).
- The main funding for this project was awarded as scholarship from Mexico's
[Council of Science and Technology](https://www.conacyt.gob.mx/). I am
thankful for their support.

My [**resume** is available](/assets/pdf/CarlosMoralesResume2020.pdf) with detail about previous work
experience and education history.
