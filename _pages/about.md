I am currently on the final stretch of a PhD project where I have been applying
**Agent-Based Modelling** to study complex biological phenomena using [FlameGPU](http://www.flamegpu.com/)
and **multiprocessing** both in HPC and commodity hardware environments.

Some achievements of this project:
- It has been awarded a few best poster prizes at international conferences and
showcases.
- A [virtual reality serious game](https://cmoralesmx.github.io/FertilizationVR_web/),
product of my PhD, has been invited for demonstration at a series of public
talks across the UK sponsored by the [Society for Reproduction and Fertility](https://srf-reproduction.org/).
- The main funding for this project was awarded as scholarship from Mexico's
[Council of Science and Technology](https://www.conacyt.gob.mx/). I am
thankful for their support.

My [**resume** is available](/assets/pdf/CarlosMoralesResume2020.pdf) with detail about previous work
experience and education history.

I am a bit of a philomath with eclectic ***interests*** and just recently started
writing about it on my blog [think, code, cycle](/blog). The topics I care about are,
- ***OSS development***. I maintain [gggaps](https://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/gggap){:target="\_blank"}, an R package for easily adding splits to the vertical axis of plots. I have contributed code to other projects, some are available at my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cmoralesmx)
- ***GNU/Linux***. My main computer runs on [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/){:target="\_blank"}.
My [home network](/blog/2020/home-network-fully-run-on-linux), like most of the
world's infrastructure, runs on GNU/Linux.
- ***Cloud Computing***. I am preparing to get certified as an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
solutions architect
- ***Reading***. I quite enjoy getting immersed in non-fiction works especially
of the biography, history, and travelogue type. For some time, I kept track of
the books I read using [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16552304-carlos).
Nowadays, my reading is focused on scientific literature and technical documents.
- ***Travelling***. Nothing beats seeing new places with my own eyes!
I find myself fascinated by the experience of experiencing other cultures and
their cuisines while getting a boost on my problem solving skills. Sadly, but
understandably, this is on pause at the moment.
- ***Road cycling***. I have had the fortune of living in a city with plenty of hilly
roads to enjoy, some of national hill climbing fame while others have been
featured in a few of the toughest cycling routes in the UK. I thrive pushing
myself to go further, faster. I keep track of my outings using [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/20777326).
