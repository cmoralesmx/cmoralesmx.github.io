My site uses the [al-folio](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/) template. 


A simple, clean, and responsive [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for 
academics originally based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio)
by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) under the MIT license.

Nowadays, the template was fully re-write and many additional features were added.

Go visit their template's site!
